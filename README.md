# AI-Driven Maze Game

A Python-based simulation and visualization system for training and evaluating an autonomous agent in a 2D grid maze. This project uses a Hybrid AI approach, combining Q-Learning with A* heuristic guidance to improve learning speed.

## Features
* **Hybrid Policy:** Uses Q-Learning as the core mechanism and A* for guided exploration.
* **Visual Mode:** Real-time rendering using PyGame to watch the agent learn.
* **Headless Mode:** High-speed training without rendering to maximize throughput.
* **Data Logging:** Automatic CSV export of success rates, steps, and rewards.

## Requirements
* Python 3.10+
* NumPy >= 1.21
* PyGame
* Pandas and Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AI-Driven-Maze-Game.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AI-Driven-Maze-Game.git)
