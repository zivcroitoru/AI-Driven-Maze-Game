# AI-Driven Maze Game

[cite_start]A Python-based simulation and visualization system for training and evaluating an autonomous agent in a 2D grid maze[cite: 64]. [cite_start]This project uses a Hybrid AI approach, combining Q-Learning with A* heuristic guidance to improve learning speed[cite: 68, 72].

## Features
* [cite_start]**Hybrid Policy:** Uses Q-Learning as the core mechanism and A* for guided exploration[cite: 70, 71].
* [cite_start]**Visual Mode:** Real-time rendering using PyGame to watch the agent learn[cite: 76, 97].
* [cite_start]**Headless Mode:** High-speed training without rendering to maximize throughput[cite: 77, 114].
* [cite_start]**Data Logging:** Automatic CSV export of success rates, steps, and rewards[cite: 98, 232].

## Requirements
* [cite_start]Python 3.10+ [cite: 119]
* [cite_start]NumPy >= 1.21 [cite: 120]
* [cite_start]PyGame [cite: 572]
* [cite_start]Pandas and Matplotlib [cite: 120]
